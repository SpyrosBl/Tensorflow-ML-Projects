# Tensorflow-ML-Projects
Training on ML using Tensorflow and Kaggle Datasets
In this repository i store some small projects/excercises implemented on VS Code and PyCharm while trying to learn Tensorflow. I rewrote the whole code by scratch to learn and understand the code, functions, definitions etc. For these excercises i used the Fashion MNIST Dataset and the Cats and Dogs datasets. Both can be found on Kaggle, although the code is implemented to automatically download them. 
# Note that the Simple CNN file will not deliver a better accuracy than the file on CNN folder as it implements less layers, no image augmentation etc
